#### ArduPilot

You can run ArduPilot on Raspberry Pi 3 or 2 with Navio2. The autopilot's code works directly on Raspberry Pi. For ArduPilot to work properly please use the configured Raspbian distribution that we provide.  


#### 安装ArduPilot

Newest versions of Emlid Raspbian has preinstalled ArduPilot package. It includes all vehicles and is based on the most stable branch available. Currently these are:

* ArduPlane 3.7.0
* ArduRover 3.0.1
* ArduCopter 3.4.3-rc1

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install apm-navio2
```
Navio2 is supported in ArduPilot upstream and if you'd like to build the binary yourself please proceed to the [Building from sources](building-from-sources.md).

#### 下载稳定版二进制文件

Also you can download the latest stable binary files from ardupilot buildserver. To download arducopter-quad binary:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ wget http://firmware.eu.ardupilot.org/Copter/stable/navio2-quad/arducopter-quad
pi@navio: ~ $ chmod +x arducopter-quad
```
In case of use another frame type, change tail of the link. For example `/navio2-hexa/arducopter-hexa`. Supported vehicle types are listed below:

* ArduRover
* ArduPlane
* ArduCopter-quad
* ArduCopter-tri
* ArduCopter-hexa
* ArduCopter-y6
* ArduCopter-octa
* ArduCopter-octa-quad
* ArduCopter-heli
* ArduCopter-single

Navio2 is supported in ArduPilot upstream and if you'd like to build the binary yourself please proceed to the [Building from sources](building-from-sources.md).

#### Systemd

For launching ArduPilot we are using `systemd` init system which provides manager for all services and processes.
The main command used to control systemd is `systemctl`. Some of its uses are:
- examining the system state
- managing the system and services.

See `man systemctl` for more details.

#### 运行ArduPilot

If you run ArduPilot for the first time you should make some preparations.  
First you need to edit `ardupilot.service` file, where you choose ArduPilot for your vehicle type.

Open the file:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/ardupilot.service
```

All lines marked '#' are comments and have no effect on ArduPilot service. So you need to uncomment one line to launch quadcopter/plane or rover on Navio 2.  
For example if you want to run `arducopter-octa`, you should remove '#' symbol from corresponding line in ardupilot.service file:

```bash
### Uncomment one of these to launch quadcopter/plane or rover on Navio 2 #####

#ExecStart=/opt/ardupilot/navio2/arducopter/bin/arducopter-quad $ARDUPILOT_OPTS
#ExecStart=/opt/ardupilot/navio2/arducopter/bin/arducopter-hexa $ARDUPILOT_OPTS
ExecStart=/opt/ardupilot/navio2/arducopter/bin/arducopter-octa $ARDUPILOT_OPTS
#ExecStart=/opt/ardupilot/navio2/arducopter/bin/arducopter-single $ARDUPILOT_OPTS
#ExecStart=/opt/ardupilot/navio2/arduplane/bin/arduplane $ARDUPILOT_OPTS
```

To launch binary that was either build from sources or downloaded, edit the last section of the file:
```bash
# Uncomment and modify this line if you want to launch your own binary
#ExecStart=/home/pi/<path>/<to>/<your>/<binary> $ARDUPILOT_OPTS
```
For example change `<path>/<to>/<your>/<binary>` to `downloads/arducopter-quad`.


Next you should change options which ArduPilot will get on start up. Open `/etc/default/ardupilot` file:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo nano /etc/default/ardupilot
```

Here you can specify ip of your ground station and another ArduPilot's standard arguments:

```bash
# Options to pass to ArduPilot
ARDUPILOT_OPTS="-A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 -C /dev/ttyAMA0"
```

Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the device with the Ground Control Station - your laptop, smartphone etc.

Mapping between switches and serial ports (TCP or UDP can be used instead of serial ports):

* -A - serial 0 (always console; default baud rate 115200)  
* -C - serial 1 (normally telemetry 1; default baud rate 57600)  
* -D - serial 2 (normally telemetry 2; default baud rate 57600)  
* -B - serial 3 (normally 1st GPS; default baud rate 38400)  
* -E - serial 4 (normally 2st GPS; default baud rate 38400)  
* -F - serial 5  

Additionally take a look at [list of serial parameters](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html?highlight=serial#serial-parameters) for Mission Planner.

When using UART for telemetry please keep in mind that serial ports have default baud rates.   
3DR Radios are configured for 57600 by default, so the simplest way to connect over them is to run with -C option.

=======

When using UART for telemetry please note that default baud rates are:  
115200 for primary (-A)  
57600 for secondary (-C)  
3DR Radios are configured for 57600 by default, so the simplest way to connect over them is to run with -C option.
If you would like to transfer telemetry over the UART port on Navio you can specify it like this:

```bash
ARDUPILOT_OPTS="-C /dev/ttyAMA0"

```

UDP and serial telemetry can be used simultaneously like this:
```bash
ARDUPILOT_OPTS="-A udp:192.168.1.2:14550 -C /dev/ttyAMA0"
```


When all changes are done use the following command to reload configurations:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

*Note: You need to repeat above steps only if you want to run another binary or change
options passed to ArduPilot.*

Now you can start ArduPilot:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo systemctl start ardupilot.service
```

To stop the service run:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo systemctl stop ardupilot.service
```

#### Autostarting ArduPilot on boot

To automatically start ArduPilot on boot you need to enable `ardupilot.service`:

```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo systemctl enable ardupilot.service
```

To disable the autostart:
```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ sudo systemctl disable ardupilot.service
```

You can check is ArduPilot already enabled or not:
```bash
pi@navio: ~ $ systemctl is-enabled ardupilot.service
```


#### Connecting to the GCS

**Mission Planner**

A Windows only ground station. It is the most feature complete, though.

**QGroundControl**

A crossplatform ground station for Mavlink-based flight stacks (like Ardupilot).

**APM Planner**

APM Planner is a ground station software for ArduPilot. It can be downloaded from the
[ardupilot.com](http://ardupilot.com/downloads/?category=35)

APM Planner listens on UDP port 14550, so it should catch telemetry from the drone automatically.

**MAVProxy**

MAVProxy is a console-oriented ground station software written in Python. It’s well suited for advanced users and developers.

To install MAVProxy use [Download and Installation](http://ardupilot.github.io/MAVProxy/html/getting_started/download_and_installation.html) instructions.


To run it specify the --master port, which can be serial, TCP or UDP. It also can perform data passthrough using --out option.

```bash
mavproxy.py --master 192.168.1.2:14550 --console
```

Where 192.168.1.2 is the IP address of the GCS, not RPi.
